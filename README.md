## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. The dataset used is from [Kaggle's House Prices competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a home based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **train.csv**: Data for training the model.
- **test.csv**: Data for model evaluation.
- **data_description.txt**: Feature descriptions.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
